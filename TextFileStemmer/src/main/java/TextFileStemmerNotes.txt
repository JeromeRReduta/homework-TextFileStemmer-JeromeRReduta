TextFileStemmer Notes

General idea:
	Really, only 2 algorithms: listStems() & uniqueStems()

	But 3 different version of each algorithm, based on how they process text and whether they need stemmer:
		1) Line by line, input stemmer
		2) Line by line, no input stemmer
		3) Whole file at once, no input stemmer

	So: design 1) first, and then 2) will be based on 1), and 3) based on 2)

listStems():
	

	//Note: CharSequence is abstract interface - String implements CharSequence (so can just use String when it calls for CharSequence)

	Given:
		1) String called line
		2) Stemmer called stemmer

	Goals:
		1) Parse the line
		2) Stem every word in the parsed line
		3) Return an ArrayList<String> containing every stem

	Pseudocode - level 1:
		set String[] called words = TextParser.parse(line)

		set ArrayList<String> called result

		for each item in words:
			stem each word w/ stemmer
			change each stemmed word back to a string
			add it to result

		return result	

	Pseudocode - level 2:
		set Stemmer called stemmer = whatever algorithm we're supposed to use
		return listStems(line, stemmer)

	Pseudocode - level 3:
		set ArrayList<String> called result
		
		set Scanner called scan = Scanner(set to inputFile)

		for each line in inputFile:
			add return values of listStems(scan.nextLine()) to result

		return result
